jaytracer.
very simple ray tracer in java, currently outputs to .ppm
requires apache.commons.math
currently uses internally defined 3d objects, only spheres and planes.
To run after compilation - java RayDriver2 <filename>
where the file in <filename> describes all settings and scene.
an example setup file is included as example.txt.
further information on setup files and their construction is in setup.txt


currently only supports basic raycasting and reflections, colour mixing for
reflections needs fixing.

high priority TODOs:
Refraction
Specular Shading
Shadows
Replacing naive intersection finding algorithm
