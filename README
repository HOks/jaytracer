jaytracer.
very simple ray tracer in java, currently outputs to .ppm
currently uses internally defined 3d objects, only spheres and planes.
no-interface as such, must edit RayDriver.java to construct desired scene,
screen position, camera position, resolution, raytrace recursion depth and
output filename.

currently only supports basic raycasting and reflections, colour mixing for
reflections needs fixing.

high priority TODOs:
Refraction
Specular Shading
Shadows
Replacing naive intersection finding algorithm
